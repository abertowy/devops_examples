## 2. Azure Policy <a name="question2"></a>

Azure Policy is a service in Azure that enables you to create, assign, and manage policies that control or audit your resources. These policies enforce different rules across your resource configurations so that those configurations stay compliant with corporate standards.  

Azure Policy enables you to define both individual policies and groups of related policies, known as initiatives. Azure Policy evaluates your resources and highlights resources that aren't compliant with the policies you've created. Azure Policy can also prevent noncompliant resources from being created.  

Azure Policies are inherited  
Azure Policy also integrates with Azure DevOps by applying any continuous integration and delivery pipeline policies that pertain to the pre-deployment and post-deployment phases of your applications.  

An Azure Policy **initiative** is a way of grouping related policies together. The initiative definition contains all of the policy definitions to help track your compliance state for a larger goal.  

Under this initiative, the following policy definitions are included:
- **Monitor unencrypted SQL Database in Security Center:** This policy monitors for unencrypted SQL databases and servers.
- **Monitor OS vulnerabilities in Security Center:** This policy monitors servers that don't satisfy the configured OS vulnerability baseline.
- **Monitor missing Endpoint Protection in Security Center:** This policy monitors for servers that don't have an installed endpoint protection agent.

## 3. Resource locks <a name="question3"></a>

A resource lock prevents resources from being accidentally deleted or changed.  
Resource locks prevent resources from being deleted or updated, depending on the type of lock. Resource locks can be applied to individual resources, resource groups, or even an entire subscription. Resource locks are inherited, meaning that if you place a resource lock on a resource group, all of the resources within the resource group will also have the resource lock applied.  

- **Delete** means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource.
- **ReadOnly** means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role.

## 4. Service Trust portal <a name="question4"></a>

The Microsoft Service Trust Portal is a portal that provides access to various content, tools, and other resources about Microsoft security, privacy, and compliance practices.
